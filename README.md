# Networks
This repo contains code scripts useful for analysing complex networks. 

## Content
* **Network properties:** Plots the Complementary Cummulative Degree distribution, mean clustering and av.nearest neighbors spectrums automatically for any number of edgelist-formatted networks. It also provides a file with other basic informative metrics. 
* **Hypermaps:** Plots the embedding of any suitable complex network in a hyperbolic disk --following the S1/H2 network geometry formalism. In the example colors are given according to node states =(red/blue) obtained from a voter dynamics.

## Notice
* Some code is old and runs in python 2.7.
